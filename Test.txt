Write a C++ program that have two classes Subject and Student class. 
The Subject class has data member subject:<array of string> that hold 
the data in the file subject.dat. Also included in the class are the 
member functions DisplaySubject(), getSubject()and deleteSubject() in 
which the latter two functions takes in argument of type integer that 
corresponds to the line number of a subject in the file starting from the first line. 
The class constructor reads in the subject.dat file into the subject variable while 
the DisplaySubject() displays the list of the subjects.

The Student class consist of data members Surname, Firstname, School, Programme 
(Science, Arts or Social Science)
 and Subject. It also has member functions PrintSubject() that prints the list to 
the screen as shown in the format shown in Fig. B.  The RegisterSubject() allows 
the student to register exactly three subjects non-repeating. The PrintRegistration() 
displays the studentâ€™s names, School, Programme and the subjects in cascading order 
as depicted in Fig C. The constructor within the Student class is used initialize the 
class variables for student to John DOE, ABC University, Arts and blank subjects value.

In the main function, instantiate objects of class Subject and Students. 
Display the list of subjects and asked the user to choice one. Query the Subject 
object to return a subject from the list based on your choice. Pass the returned 
subject and number 1 to the Student object to register the subject. Using the 
subject number chosen, delete the subject from the Subject object and then print 
the list of register subject from the Student object. Repeat this process three time 
and in each case increase the number passed to the Student object by one. 
Finally using the Student object print the registered student information on the screen.
